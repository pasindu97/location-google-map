				<p>Every single Daredevil fan will be hoping to get the perfect Christmas present which confirms that 'The Man Without Fear' will be returning in some iteration, but after the news that the show was cancelled, fans have bene holding onto the hope that Matt Murdock will rise from the ashes of the Netflix show.

Hell, after all, he did survive a building falling on top of him, so we reckon Daredevil can survive that heartbreaking decision by the studio executives.

Of course, Disney are about launch their own streaming site, leading plenty of fans to hope that the devil of Hell's Kitchen will be making a return on that platform.

However, Variety reports there is a clause in the deal between Netflix and Marvel that prevents the latter from including the characters in new TV shows or films for two years after cancellation. They've reported that the cancelled Marvel Netflix TV shows - Daredevil, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist - can't be rebooted by Disney and Marvel Studios until 2020 at the earliest.

This being said, hope springs eternal for Daredevil fans and Kevin Mayer, chairman of Walt Disney direct-to-consumer and international division, has said that there's a possibility that Daredevil will be coming back.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Mayer was asked if he would consider reviving the cancelled Marvel shows.

He said: "They are very high-quality shows. We haven't yet discussed that, but I would say that's a possibility."</p>

<p>With regards to the remaining Marvel shows that will be arriving on Netflix, Season 2 of The Punisher lands in January while Jessica Jones is set to be released later in the year.
